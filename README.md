# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## How to run
After unzipping this project the application can be started by simply opening index.html in the browser.

At the top of the page you will see the feedreader, scrolling down will show you the Jasmine test results.

All the tests have been supplied and passed.

The functionality of the feedreader itself is unchanged.
Clicking on the menu icon toggles the visibility of the menu.

Clicking on a menu item filteres the results.

Cicking on a link will open the corresponding blogitem.
